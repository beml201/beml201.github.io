    <h1><u>About Me</u></h1>
    <p>Hi, I'm Brandon and I currently work as a Graduate Research Assistant at the University of Exeter<br>
        I studied maths at uni and worked for a bit as an intern in the reinsurance sector<br>
        As you'd expect, I've picked up a number of weird skills that sometime crossover and sometimes don't<br>
        But that's OK because I like to think of maths as a useful tool that can be applied in many many different areas<br>
        My current work in genomics has taught me a number of new techniques that I hope will apply to many different areas, 
        creating a very cross-curricular system<br>
        All of this helps me to try to "think outside the box" which helps my do what I would like to do the most: problem solving<br>
        I also wanted to put up some fun plots (of public data!) using plotly to make them interactive<br>
        Interactivity allows people to view the data much mre easiy, and I think it's a particualrly useful tool for anyone doing data science or anything similar<br>
        <br>
        My hobbies are an even weirder mix, I've been doing kung fu since I was small, like playing my ukulele, play a bit with yoyos and also surf (hence Exeter!)<br>
        I'm always looking for more fun stuff, so chat to me about anything!
    </p>
